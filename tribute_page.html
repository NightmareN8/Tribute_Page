        <h2>Timeline of Jimmy's life</h2>
        <ul id="timeline" class="timeline">
          <li>Jimmy Buffett was born on Dec. 25, 1946 in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and raised partially in Alabama. 

After graduating from college with a history degree, Buffett worked briefly as a writer for Billboard magazine, and also spent several years working on a fishing boat before releasing his first album, Down to Earth, in 1970.</li>
          <li>It was Buffett's 1977 single "Margaritaville," off the album Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes, that really put him on the map.

Buffett continued to release a steady stream of albums over the next few decades, but became known mainly as a massive concert draw, with his annual shows with his Coral Reefer Band raking in millions for the star.</li>
          <li>Buffett released more than 30 albums over his career, and was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for "Hey Good Lookin'," his 2004 song with Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Clint Black and Toby Keith, and the Alan Jackson duet "It's Five O'Clock Somewhere," which was released in 2003. The latter won him his lone major music honor, a CMA Award for vocal event of the year.
Despite his devoted fan base and the popularity of his songs, he never had a solo No. 1 on the Billboard charts ("Margaritaville" peaked at No. 8).</li>
          <li>Buffett was forced to reschedule a concert in May of 2023 after he was hospitalized in Boston "to address some issues that needed immediate attention," he told fans in a statement shared to Twitter. "Growing old is not for sissies, I promise you."

He died from Merkel cell skin cancer on September 1, 2023, at 76 years old.

â€œJimmy passed away peacefully on the night of September 1st surrounded by his family, friends, music and dogs," read a statement shared to social media and his website, accompanied by a touching photograph of Buffett sitting on a boat. "He lived his life like a song till the very last breath and will be missed beyond measure by so many."</li>
